## Environment setup

### Development
Create a `nodemon.js` file using the following format.
```json
{
  "env" : {
    "API_KEY" : "<PTCG API key>",
    "DB_HOST" : "<host>",
    "DB_NAME" : "<name>",
    "DB_USER" : "<username>",
    "DB_PASSWORD" : "<password>",
    "DB_DIALECT" : "<dialect>"  
  }
}
```

An database dialect could be `mariadb`. See [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/) doc for other options.


### Production
Create a .env file using the following format.
``` bash
API_KEY=<PTCG Api-key>
DB_HOST=<host>
DB_NAME=<name>
DB_USER=<username>
DB_PASSWORD=<password>
DB_DIALECT=<dialect>
```

An database dialect could be `mariadb`. See [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/) doc for other options.
